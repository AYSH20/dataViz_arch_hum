# Data Visualization for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities
* Columbia University | GSAPP and A&S | **??** | Spring 2017
* Fridays 9am - 11am | Studio @ Butler
* Office hours: Mondays 10am - 12pm (previous email required)
* Professor: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga (jfs2118)
* Teaching Assistant: Buck Fivel (brw2103)

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to data visualization theory and methods for students entirely new to the fields of computation and information design. Through a series of in-class exercises and take-home assignments, students will learn how to critically engage and produce interactive data visualization pieces that can serve as exploratory and analytical tools. The course is part of a larger initiative, hosted by the Center for Spatial Research to teach courses in the critical use of digital tools across fields in architecture, urbanism, and the humanities.

The course will be centered around a semester long data visualization group project, through which the students will learn the basics of data visualization, data analysis, data collection, programming and versioning control. However, even though the course will teach specific programming languages and tools, the main conceptual thread of the class will be centered around how work with data, both in the humanities and in architecture and urbanism. Students will define their final projects around their own interests, and will bring their own datasets into their final projects.

## General Topics
* Basic data visualization history and concepts
* Data types
* APIs and Web-scraping
* Versioning control
* Interactivity
* Programming and web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python)
* **??**

## Evaluation and Grading
* 10% Class participation and discussion
* 20% Individual assignments and tutorials
* 15% Midterm presentation
* 20% Data visualization critique
* 35% Final project and final presentation and report

## Resources and Materials
Course files, tutorials and presentations will be located on Courseworks, on the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/) website and on this repository.

The readings for the class will be duly uploaded to Courseworks. Similarly, students will be required to submit their assignments by uploading them to Courseworks. Finally, the class will also rely heavily on submissions
to the blog. Students will be required to upload some of their own work as well as inspirational material, encouraging and developing a critical stance and visual skills.

## Brainstorming
* Creating a basic website (local)
  * Create HTML and CSS and open it with Chrome (not live)
  * Running a local server
  * Brief terminal commands
  * How does this work in Windows **----??----**
* Taking that website live (Github):
  * Versioning concept
  * Branches
  * Add / Commit / Push / Fetch / Pull
  * gh-pages branch
* Programming basics (in p5 with a Python exercise in the middle):
  * Print (console?)
  * Data types:
    * Start by doing mathematical operations (dealing with `int` and `float`)
    * Work with `str`
    * `Arrays`
    * `Dictionaries`
    * Language Elements:
      * **Data-type**: Set of values and operations that may be used on those values.
      * **Class**: A computer representation of a data-type.
      * **Object**: A computer representation of a data-type value. Three parts: identity, type, value
      * **Object reference**: The location of an object in computer memory.
      * **Literals**: Symbolic representation of built-in number and string data-type values. Examples: _3, "happy".
      * **Identifier**: Symbolic representation of a name. In Python this is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores. May not begin with a digit.
      * **Variable**: Conceptually this is just a name associated with a data-type value. So an Identifier is the Python symbolic representation of that name. More formally, in Python it is a location in memory that stores a reference to an object.
      * **Operators**: Symbolic representation of a data-type operation. Examples: +, /, //
      * **Keywords**: Reserved words that may not be used to name. These are the vocabulary of a programming language. Python has only a few dozen.
      * **Delimiters (punctuators)**: Symbols used to separate language elements.
      * **Statement**: A logical line of code that performs some task.
      * **Expression**: A sequence of literals, operators, variables, and delimiters that evaluate to some value.
  * Conditional statements
  * Loops (recursive)
  * Functions
    * Built in functions (`print`, `draw`, `setup`)
    * Creating new functions
    * Libraries
  * Objects
* From Enrico's [course](https://wikis.nyu.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=53861653):
  * Visualization overview (**)
  * Basic charts (**)
  * "High information graphics" (what is this? abstract? or more complex charts?) (**)
  * Interactive visualization (**)
  * Design process (**)
  * Color maps (?)
  * Data abstraction (?)
  * Visual encoding & graphical perception (**)
  * Networks and trees
  * Maps
  * Time oriented data
* **Two vectors of work: different types of data and different types of representation.**
* Other concepts:
  * Transition
  * Animation
  * Specific tools for dealing with text
  * APIs
  * Do we need a specific class or workshop on **colors**?
* **It is as much about getting and analyzing the data as it is about visualizing it in a compelling, meaningful and engaging way.**
* We need one or two well done sessions on **data analysis**.
* Do we need to talk about mobile-ready design? (Bootstrap?)
* **It is not about the specific tools or languages, it is about data, how to deal with it, how to collect it, how does it look, how to organize it, parse it and analyze it, and about visualizing it, the importance of visualizing, the uses of visualization and the inner workings of visualization.**
* **It is also about programming but in a high-level way, its concepts, not its minutiae.**

## Possible exercises
* Create a matrix of data visualization types & types of data
* Examples of great data visualization projects (one big one that they can present to the class)
* Visualization without data
* Work with weather data ([forecast.io API](https://developer.forecast.io/))
* Work with literary text data (**)
* Work with personal data (**)
* Work with stock market data
* Work with city data (**)
* Work with census data ([citysdk](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/)?)
* Querying APIs (Python or live in JavaScript)
* Prototype drawing by hand (**)
* Possible structure of exercises:
  * Build a simple website
  * Matrix of visualizations and data
  * Explore and present one visualization
  * Create first visualization prototype (fixed dataset) (maybe this one goes earlier?) and present it and defend it. Feel free to transform the data. What story are you trying to tell? (individual or in groups? depends on how many peeps we get)
  * Put the visualization on the web
  * Make it interactive, responsive, live
  * Write about a visualization
  * Final project
