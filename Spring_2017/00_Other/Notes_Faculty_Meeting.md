## Notes Faculty Meeting on Data Visualization Class

### Questions:
* Prior experience in programming
* What is your experience with teaching programming to humanities
* What types of datasets do they want to work with
* Any interesting data visualization for humanities projects

### Notes:
* Urban questions
* Not maps at all
* What is data visualization:
  * Any time you take information findings and present it in a non linguistic form - synoptic - not purely linguistic
  * Is there a history of data visualization? How is this history different than a history of cartography for example?
  * Ted Byfield (??) history of data visualization linking to military...
  * Divorced from the academic context in which they were produced
  * Literacy to understand data visualization
  * Holistic approach to data visualization, not linearly
  * Naive inferences: misreading the graphical elements
  * Being able to interrogate the data: origins and what is being expressed there, sample size, etc
  * Make sure the students publish their data along with their pieces
  * How to visualize absence and ambiguity? Or uncertainty. ie. Mapping male by foot in medieval India (Emily). Ask Alex for a link.
  * Jefferson archive for traces of Sally Hemmings
* Datasets:
  * Email asking for datasets to the bootcamp faculty
  * Where people were selling books, who reads, who is purchasing books, which books are being purchased
  * Performance history, records from a particular theater, ticket prices
  * Ohio State university library (ask Sharon for the source)
  * Library data (ask Alex) - we need to anonymize the data
  * Moma collection of images
  * Menu collection at the NYPL
  * Bahaus at Harvard collection
  * Linguistic landscapes: how do you define the area? how are they supposed to notice certain things? can you look at data through time or through space? Count, percentages, structures and patterns?
  * Don Quijote vs. Twitter
  * "Medascapes" - no text outside of media
  * Which signs are meaningful and which ones are not, and meaningful for whom and in which context?
  * Question about the context, and basic concepts (what is Asian and in what context - Asian diasporic art) - What are the limitations in those definitions
  * Guest lectures and describe the process in detail, what did they do? how did they go about?
  * Pirate library data (Alex)
  * Annual corporate reports (mid 1800s to mid 1900s) (ask Jeremiah)
  * Geobibliography (Alex) - mapping the republic of letters (Stanford)
  * Footprints - mapping out Jewish texts through history (libraries at Columbia)
* Programming:
  * Two populations: Novices (don't know names of programs, acronyms) / some familiarity or taught themselves before
  * Fear that you will hurt my computer
  * Don't know how to run with something
  * Novices need a lot at the beginning
  * Double pedagogy
  * Familiar with the language but not familiar with the context and vice versa - play the traffic cop, stuck in the middle
  * Alex - students won't be able to get anywhere by themselves, they need to collaborate - those who are familiar need to work with the ones who are not comfortable - do we need specific division of labor? Like Danils class?
  * Break down the code line by line
  * Give handout, that has challenge questions in the middle, so that the ones that know are challenged
  * Psedudo-code
  * Emphasis on qualitative (!!!) - reframe the course description so that it doesn't put off students that don't know
    * "Temporality"
    * "Picturing though using computers"
    * What are the research questions that humanities deal with
    * Look at Dennis Course description and the language that he uses
    * Johana Drukner
  * Lessons where captured in video
  * One exercise is to take a piece of code and comment it - tell us what the code is doing (**) - teach people to annotate code (learning center)
  * Set Cable (Columbia) taught cartography in precolonial Spanish America (contact him through Alex)
  * What other spaces are possible? When you are not doing a map, how to visualize geographical ideas in ways that are not maps
  * Can we actually rename the course?? Suggestion by Sharon
