### Assignment 2 - Detailed Presentation of a Data Visualization Project (Group Assignment)
There are many great data visualization projects out there. In this assignment, your group will create a website deconstructing and analyzing one of these projects. By doing this, you will understand how a project like this is built, what its different levels of information and interactivity are and how it creates engagement and narrative.

While building your website, think of it as a presentation tool:
* What is the sequence going to be? Are there different sections?
* And if so, how are you going to separate and navigate these different parts?
* What images should you include to give a full picture of the project and what images should you include to highlight specific moments or pieces?

Also, think about the project as if it was building or a text:
* What is this project trying to achieve?
* What data is it using? How did they get that data? How did they process it?
* Does it have a point of view or does it try to be 'neutral'?
* What are the limitations of the project? Does it achieve everything it set out to?
* Where does this project really shine? Why is it a great example?

#### Deliverables
Your group should build a stand-alone website that presents, explores and critiques the project. You should provide appropriate links, images and text and make sure the website is easy to understand and use. As always, think carefully about the layout and design of your site (think about making a mock-up in Illustrator before you start coding). In theory, you should be able to justify every single pixel on your site.

**You should be ready give a 5-10 minute presentation of your website/project.**

### Due Date
* Submit your site's URL and a link to your Github repository to Courseworks before the end of **Thursday, February 16**.
