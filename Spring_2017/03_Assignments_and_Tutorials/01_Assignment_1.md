### Assignment 1 - Website and Type of Data Visualization (Individual Assignment)
There are many ways of visualizing data and many types of charts and graphs. Some of these are appropriate to specific types of information while others are more flexible. However, it is always necessary to think carefully about how to best visualize the data and to choose your tools and graphic elements accordingly. In this assignment you will explore one type of chart or graph and describe its most appropriate use.

#### Deliverables
* For this assignment you should create a basic **website** using Github pages in which you explore the assigned type of chart or graph.
* Your website should have a **landing page** with a brief bio and a **second page** where you explore a specific type of visualization (don't forget to include a link to your second page from your landing page).
* In this exploration you should provide the following elements:
  * **Description** of the chart or graph
  * **Images and examples** of the chart or graph in other projects ('in the wild')
  * **Types of data** for which the chart or graph is appropriate
  * Brief description of **how to build** the chart or graph (what are the axis, what other elements does it need, what software or tools facilitate the building of this type of chart).
  * **Advantages** and **disadvantages** or this type of graph.
* Think carefully about the layout and graphic elements of your site. Start experimenting with fonts, colors and styles. As always, *you should be able to justify every single pixel on your site*.
