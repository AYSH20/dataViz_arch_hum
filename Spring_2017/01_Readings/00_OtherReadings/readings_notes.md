# Readings Notes

## Readings YES
### (ones that I found super helpful/made sense to me as required course readings)
* Manovich, "Visualization for Media Studies"
    - introduces and helpfully explains ideas around translating "media into data," "data vs metadata," "visualizing Metadata vs. Visualizing Media," other items
* Manovich, "What is Visualization?"
    - probably too much Manovich, will need to choose among his writings, but this article also gives great overview of different kinds of visualization and what they reveal. Does so in an incremental manner, and in a way that I found helped me to know what to look for in *reading* a visualization (like I mentioned, I think this is a learned skill, like reading anything else)
* "Brief History of Visualization"
    - Good overview, sets up thinking and possibilities, frames work of course (teaches how to look at visualization)
* Drucker, "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display"
    - critically delves into and illustrates all the ways that "data" collection in the humanities is created through subjective means. Proposes the idea of "capta" (meaning, "taken") over "data" (meaning, "given"). Both thorough and to the point. I think this is a definite "yes"
* Peter Hall, "Bubbles, Lines, and String" 
    - splits out the issues at stake in information visualization for 1) scientific practice, 2) journalistic practice, and 3) artistic practice. Primary point is to emphasize the "situatedness of the observer and the phenomenon being observed." Maybe it's repetative of other material — to look at more.
* Chapter 1, "Information Visualization"
    - Thorough, textbook-like overview of different modes and methods of information visualization, what each kind is good for, as well as what it doesn't do. A little too detailed at some points, but excellent as a broad overview. More focused on actual manifestation of visualization than history-of (most others prioritize historicizing visualization rather than the techniques-of). I personally found this super helpful.
* "Design and Redesign in Data Visualization" Fernanda Viégas / Martin Wattenberg. https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9#.mha4ohu1t

## Maybe
### (articles that I found interesting or compelling for one reason or another, but uncertain whether appropriate for the course)
* Critical InfoVis
    - An overview, without much of a critical thrust. Doesn't add much that Drucker (above) doesn't already cover. Touches on critical themes that you said wanted addressed in the course, but feels repetative. On the upside, it looks at a few examples of visualization projects and discusses the uses and limits of each.
* Brescani, "The Risks of Visualization"
    - interesting overview. Easy to read (though science-y). Proposes some challenges of visualization, but mostly from the perspective of confusion for the viewer, rather than conceptual issues related to limits of visualization. Perhaps useful for that reason.
* "Accounting for ethnic and racial diversity: the challenge of enumeration"
    - Not much about visualization, but a good overview of the problematics of data collection and categorization. Goes into the rationale and practice of collecting ethnicity and race information, and how this data is problematic when these are constructed categories. Could be useful for problematizing ideas about "data" representing "pure information" (my extrapolation). Short, and well-written/easy to read, so two points on the plus side.
* "Coupling Complexity"
    - This article charts the conceptual relationship between the ideas of "ecosystems" in ecology and "loop" in cybernetics. It is a super interesting article, and it raises some really interesting points about how we consider *linking* cause and effect, or data and the meaning we derive from it (that's my extrapolation). That connection may be a little obtuse, and the article has less to do with visualization per se, so I would put this in the "maybe" category. On the plus side, it is a shorter article, and *very* readable, so I feel it is easy to get the ideas put forward. 
* "Suspicious Images"
    - Brings up ideas around challenging what, in certain cases, data visualization claims to do versus what it is actually doing, and the politics embedded in that. Easily readable (formatted as a conversation), and introduces many good questions. However, it has more questions than direct ideas to work with. I think it's a good read, but not sure exactly what the purpose of it would be, except to make explicit some political ramification of visualization choices, but I think there may be something else that could do this better.
* "Information Visualization: Challenge for the Humanities"
    - Useful for us, maybe less so for students. Looks more at specific theoretical aspects (i.e., color) than critically engaging issues around visualization
* "Poemage"
    - Nice application of visualization. Turns a poem in "data", then uses different visualizations to illustrate some of the things that become evident through this. Kind of a proof-of-concept paper.
* "Visual Apollo"
    - another overview of problems and possibilities of data visualization. But, a very helpful demonstration of how visualization can reveal something in data that explanation might not. 
* "Data Visualization as New Abstraction and Anti-Sublime." Manovich.
    -  Great, but this would make a lot of Manovich. Mostly focused on aesthetic implications of visualization, so a recommended read, but perhaps tangential to the course (as I understand it, so maybe not)  
 * Barabasi, "Scale-Free networks"
     - application of node-based visualization. not really introducing an idea, but is a walk-through of how visualization helps to explain a concept (in this case, scale-free networks). Helpful as a demonstration, but not conceptually compelling. Maybe to read along with other things.


## No
### (Readings I found not helpful or pertinent for the course, based on my understanding)
* Asokarajan
    - example of applying visualization to ancient greek texts. Super dense and opaque, very hard to read.
* "Shaping the Absence"
    - Very specific and focused on a particular architectural issue. Not about *data* visualization. Concerned with how ideas about architectural design could be applied to other areas of design, but way too focused for our purposes.
* "Scorecards as Devices for Consumer Credit"
    - This is a history of the credit scorecard, and has some relevance to the issue of data collection and choosing which data is important, but it has very little connection to any ideas around representing or visualizing that data.
* "Principles of Categorization"
    - Very thorough introduction to theories of cognitive categorization. Potentially useful for considering how representation of data communicates in categories that may entail more/less/other information than intended, but I think too fine-grained for really being necessary for this course. Very neuroscience-y. 
* Cleveland articles
    - no, very detailed on a technical level — what the eye perceives more easily, with more difficulty. not the kind of reading being sought for in this course.
* Visualizing Domestic Violence
    - not much about visualization. Good questions, but hard to apply. Questioning photographs, mostly — can make the point and extend to data, but don't really need to read this to do that.
